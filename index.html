    <h2>Giyu Tomioka</h2>
    <p><strong>Age:</strong> 21</p>
    <p><strong>Breathing Style:</strong> Water Breathing</p>
    <p>As the stoic Water Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, Giyu saved Nezuko and spared Tanjiro’s life during their first encounter. He continually pushes Tanjiro to refine his Water Breathing techniques.</p>
    <p class="relation">Both are Water Breathing users—Giyu recognized Tanjiro’s potential and passed on this style to him.</p>

    <h2>Muichiro Tokito</h2>
    <p><strong>Age:</strong> 14</p>
    <p><strong>Breathing Style:</strong> Mist Breathing</p>
    <p>The young Mist Hashira who initially struggles with fragmented memories. His calm, otherworldly demeanour belies a fierce determination once roused.</p>
    <p class="relation">Muichiro is Tanjiro’s close friend—Tanjiro helped him recover his lost memories and supported him through battle, so Muichiro treats him like his best friend.</p>
